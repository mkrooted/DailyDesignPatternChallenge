# Design Pattern Challenge
by mkrooted

Daily Design Pattern Challenge - new pattern every day! (or less often -\_o\_-). 
Thank to www.exceptionnotfound.net

One day I decided to discover such great tool as programming design patterns. 
But simply writing example classes is quite dull activity, so every class in this project will interact with Cute Narwhals.
Why? Because narwhals are cute.

## Day 1: Factory
Design pattern allows developer to automate object construction. 
For example: instead of generating random weight and tusk length every time I instantiate CuteNarwhal class, 
we have three different factories that performs randomization by themselves
